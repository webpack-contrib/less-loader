### Notes

* using `~` is deprecated and can be removed from your code (**we recommend it**), but we still support it for historical reasons. 

Why you can removed it?
The loader will first try to resolve `@import` as relative, if it cannot be resolved, the loader will try to resolve `@import` inside [`node_modules`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-modules).

* minimum supported `webpack` version is `5`

# [4.0.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/compare/v3.0.0...v4.0.0) (2017-03-20)


### Bug Fixes

* error where not all files were watched ([53c90fc](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/53c90fc))
* resolve alias ([98d4e63](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/98d4e63))


### Chores

* **dependencies:** Update peer dependencies ([24a6f66](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/24a6f66))


### Features

* **source-maps:** refactor source maps handling ([895044f](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/895044f))
* allow user to choose between resolvers ([1d6e505](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/1d6e505))
* improve formatting of error messages ([39772a5](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/39772a5))
* make any file type importable ([d3022b8](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/d3022b8))
* remove root option ([39ad4f8](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/39ad4f8))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* If you've already configured your `resolve.alias` with a `.less` extension, you can now remove that wrong extension.
* The root option was never documented, so it's very unlikely that this is actually a breaking change. However, since the option was removed, we need to flag this as breaking.
* **dependencies:** Require webpack 2 as peer dependency
* **source-maps:** Since the map is now passed as an object to the next loader, this could potentially break if another loader than the css-loader is used. The css-loader accepts both.
